# Injection Challenges Write-Up Repository

This repository contains write-ups and solutions for various injection vulnerabilities, including SQL Injection (SQLi), Command Injection, Remote Code Execution (RCE), and Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI). All challenges were solved on [PortSwigger Web Security Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security) and some other resources that will be shared through the writeups.

## Table of Contents
- [SQL Injection (SQLi)](./sqli/)
- [Command Injection](./command_injection/)
- [Remote Code Execution (RCE)](./rce/)
- [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)](./ssti/)

Each section contains:
- A directory per lab or challenge
- Step-by-step write-up (`writeup.md`)
- Screenshots of successful exploitation (`screenshot.png`)
- Payloads, exploits or scripts used (`payload.txt`, `exploit.py`)

## Disclaimer
These write-ups are for educational purposes only. These challenges have been solved in compliance with [PortSwigger's terms of service](https://portswigger.net/terms). The author assumes no liability for misuse.

## Purpose
The goal is to document and share the methodology and payloads used to solve each lab. This helps in consolidating learning and contributes to the security research community.
